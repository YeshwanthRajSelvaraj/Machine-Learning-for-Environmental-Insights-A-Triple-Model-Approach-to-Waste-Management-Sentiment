1. Sentiment Classification Using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
Overview
This project implements a Sentiment Classification Model using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), a powerful RNN variant, combined with Word2Vec embeddings. The system categorizes textual feedback into positive and negative sentiments, unlocking actionable insights from user opinions.
Applications span across social media monitoring, product feedback analysis, and customer experience management.

Key Features
â€¢	Robust Text Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and tokenization of text data.
â€¢	Semantic Embedding: Word2Vec-based embeddings for capturing contextual word relationships.
â€¢	Sequential Learning: GRU network architecture ideal for temporal dependencies in text.
â€¢	Optimized Training: PyTorch-based training using Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
â€¢	Performance Metrics: Evaluation using classification accuracy.

Outputs
â€¢	Trained Word2Vec model
â€¢	Saved GRU model (.pth file)
â€¢	Accuracy and loss visualization graphs (optional)

Performance Summary
â€¢	Training Accuracy: ~91.2%
â€¢	Loss Curve: Smooth decline across epochs
â€¢	Model Strengths:
o	Robust against noise
o	Strong sequential dependency learning
o	Good generalization to unseen data

Future Enhancements
â€¢	Expansion to multi-class sentiment (positive, neutral, negative)
â€¢	Integration of attention mechanisms
â€¢	Deployment via Flask or FastAPI APIs
