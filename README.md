__**# Sentiment Classification Using GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**_

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Sentiment Classification Model** using **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The model is designed to classify textual data into two categories: **positive** and **negative** sentiments. The model leverages **Word2Vec embeddings** to represent words as high-dimensional vectors, which capture the contextual meaning of words within the text. This deep learning-based approach is highly effective for text classification tasks such as **sentiment analysis**, where understanding the semantics of text is crucial.

Sentiment analysis plays a significant role in industries like **social media monitoring**, **product reviews**, and **customer feedback**, providing organizations with valuable insights into customer opinions. The model implemented in this project can be used to analyze and classify sentiments in various forms of textual data.

## Key Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: The model includes a robust text preprocessing pipeline that involves cleaning the text data by removing special characters, stopwords, and converting the text to lowercase. This helps in eliminating noise from the dataset and improving the quality of training data.
  
- **Word2Vec Embeddings**: Text data is converted into vector representations using **Word2Vec** embeddings. These embeddings help capture the semantic relationships between words, allowing the model to better understand the meaning and context behind the words.

- **GRU-based Model**: The model uses **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). GRUs are particularly effective for sequential data like text, where the temporal or sequential nature of words is important. This allows the model to learn and capture the dependencies between words over a sequence of text.

- **Efficient Model Training**: The model is trained on the dataset using **PyTorch** and optimized using **Adam optimizer** with **cross-entropy loss** for binary classification.

- **Performance Evaluation**: The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using **accuracy**, a common metric for classification tasks. This gives a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
